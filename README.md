WeatherApp is a website which connects to Open Weather API (https://openweathermap.org/) in order to get weather data for given place. The app displays current weather and a simple forecast for 4 next days plus a chart. User can search for weather info in a place defined by city name, ZIP code or geo coordinates - longitude and latitude.
